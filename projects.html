            <li>Day of the week finder:
                <p>
                    With a compiler using the Java language,
                    the user enters the day of the week on the format
                    [ddmmyyyy] and the program returns which day of the week it is that one.
                    Works with dates up to 01/01/1900.
                    <br><a href="https://github.com/lucas-lentz/day-of-the-week-finder" target="_blank">This project is available here.</a>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Pharmacy CRUD system:
                <p>
                    In this system, the user uses the Java Swing interface to add, delete,
                    update and list products, as also their brands, categories and departments.
                    The user can start a sale with all the registered products. Those sales have a 
                    history that can be accessed on the platform.
                    The project was conducted for the Young Programmer course, with a team and aid of two professors
                    (Rogerio and Nazareno).
                    <br>
                    Soon to be added on GitHub.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Web Application Systems
                <p>
                    I hope, with a qualified team, to make other projects integrating Back-End with
                    Front-End. Using IDEs, frameworks and marking languages such as Spring, HTML,
                    CSS, JavaScriot and others, while also implementing Node and Reactsm, integrating this system
                    with a DBMS.
